Examining of armature controlled DC Motor’s mechanical behaviours according to torque, voltage, current, resistance, inductance, constants of DC Motor’s gearbox-load. I drawed a gearbox-load component of DC Motor on Solidworks and I operated this 3-D system to Matlab and then I set to work this servosystem.I examined how this 3-D piece works according to constant values and parameters that is taken by me.
